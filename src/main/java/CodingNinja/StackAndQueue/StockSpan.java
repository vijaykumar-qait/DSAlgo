     * Stock Span
     * Send Feedback
     * The span si of a stockâ€™s price on a certain day i is the minimum number of consecutive days (up to the current day) the price of the stock has been less than its price on that ith day. If for a particular day, if no stock price is greater then just count the number of days till 0th day including current day.
     * For eg. if given price array is {3, 6, 8, 1, 2}, span for 4th day (which has price 2) is 2 because minimum count of consecutive days (including 4th day itself) from current day which has price less than 4th day is 2 (i.e. day 3 & 4). Similarly, span for 2nd day is 3 because no stock price in left is greater than 2nd day's price. So count is 3 till 0th day.
     * Given an input array with all stock prices, you need to return the array with corresponding spans of each day.
     * Note : Try doing it in O(n).
     * Input format :
     * Line 1 : Integer n, Arrays Size
     * Line 2 : Price for n days (separated by space). It can contain duplicate values`
     * Constraints:
     * Time Limit: 1 second
     * Size of input array lies in the range: [1, 1000000]
     * Output format :
     * Return an array that contain span for each day
     * Sample Input 1 :
     * 8
     * 60 70 80 100 90 75 80 120
     * Sample Output 1 :
     * 1 2 3 4 1 1 2 8
     * Sample Input 2 :
     *  4
     *  1 1 1 1
     * Sample Output 2 :
     * 1 1 1 1
